# AI Prompt Log for NLP Project

This document contains all prompts used with the integrated AI in Google Colab.

## Phase 1: Setup & Data Loading

### Prompt #1: Import Libraries
1.	Create a Python function that imports all necessary libraries for NLP sentiment analysis including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, sklearn, and tensorflow/keras. Also include functions to download NLTK data packages (stopwords, punkt, wordnet).

### Prompt #2: Load Dataset
2.	Write Python code to load the IMDB movie review dataset from keras.datasets. Convert the integer sequences back to text using the word index. Create a pandas dataframe with columns 'review' (the actual text) and 'sentiment' (1 for positive, 0 for negative). Display the first 5 rows, dataframe shape, and data types. Include all necessary code without instructions or comments explaining alternatives.

### Prompt #3: Data Exploration
Write Python code to perform exploratory data analysis on a dataframe called 'imdb_df' with columns 'review' and 'sentiment'. Create: 1) A bar chart showing count of positive (sentiment=1) vs negative (sentiment=0) reviews, 2) A histogram showing distribution of review lengths in words, 3) Check for missing values, 4) Display 5 random sample reviews with their sentiments. Use matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations.
